# GNN_RiskStratification_DNN
In this study, a two-stage DNN is firstly proposed and developed to stratify the risk of GNN in CT image by using 3D CNN. 
Then, histopathological confirmed GGNs collected from four centers are used to train and test the DNN.
Finally, an observer study is conducted to evaluate the model performance by comparing the performance of six radiologists and our two-stage DNN.
